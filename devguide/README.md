# Sabueso — Developer Guide

The developer guide is the repository's memory: what Sabueso is, how it is built, what
was decided and why, and what comes next. Start with `CHECKPOINT.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
Contributors and agents also read `../AGENTS.md`.

To resume after a pause, read [CHECKPOINT.md, Resume here](CHECKPOINT.md#resume-here),
then [ROADMAP.md, Immediate resumption sequence](ROADMAP.md#immediate-resumption-sequence).
These separate published behavior, accumulated local work, latest qualification
and the next implementation/design steps. Detailed receipts remain linked; neither
a previous test count nor a diagnostic local wheel establishes a public release.

Every document is one of four kinds:
- **normative**: rules and contracts that code must follow;
- **living**: the current state, kept true;
- **design**: vision and architecture;
- **historical**: kept, not maintained.

The public [HK2 test system](HK2_TEST_SYSTEM.md) complements TcTIM/HsTIM with
current-source rebuilding and an integrated saved-card/report regression.

## Where to start

| Document | Kind | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `CHECKPOINT.md` | living | The current state: release, schema, layout, quality baseline, open work |
| `ROADMAP.md` | living | Both routes, objective status, and the approved next roadmap after 0.13.0: user journeys, query/traceability guarantees, peptides and parallel consumer contracts |
| `DECISIONS.md` | living (log) | Every design decision, dated, with its reason |
| `RISKS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` | living | Risks for the future, and decisions to re-evaluate |

Release preparation and receipts live in `../devtools/conda-build/`: the committed
plan, route checklist, `release_notes_0.14.0.md` and the verified exact-artifact
publication receipt for the staged release (#134),
with immutable `release_notes_0.13.0.md` and its publication receipt (#121), plus the
immutable 0.12.0 notes/publication receipt (#110). Published state stays in `CHECKPOINT.md`; a preparation plan is
not a release receipt.

## Design

| Document | Kind | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `VISION.md` | design | Definition, mission, scope, platform context, non-goals |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | design | Layers, core objects, principles, what is planned but not built |
| `DATA_FLOW.md` | design | One resolution, end to end, and its invariants |
| `USE_CASES.md` | design | Use cases of both routes (status in `ROADMAP.md`) |
| `SCIENTIFIC_POTENTIAL.md` | design | Long-term scientific direction (non-binding) |
| `GLOSSARY.md` | design | Terms |

## Contracts and conventions

| Document | Kind | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `SCHEMA.md` | normative | Card schema, SourceAssertion and relationship contracts, versioning policy |
| `FIELD_PATHS.md` | normative | Canonical field paths (checked against the schema) |
| `PUBLIC_API.md` | normative | The public surface |
| `API_CONVENTIONS.md` | normative | Naming, inputs, view conventions |
| `INTERFACES_MINIMAL.md` | normative | Core interfaces: Card, Deck, stores, resolvers |
| `RESOLVER.md` | normative | FieldResolver contract and selection rules |
| `SELECTION_RULES_EXAMPLES.md` | normative | Selection rules, field by field |
| `SOURCE_ACCESS.md` | normative | Source clients, `get_*` functions and required acquisition traceability |
| `ARGUMENT_CONTRACTS.md` | normative | ArgDigest: one digester per argument |
| `DIAGNOSTICS.md` | normative | SMonitor codes and outcomes |
| `LICENSING_AND_COMPLIANCE.md` | normative | Source licences and obligations |
| `TESTS.md` | normative | Test kinds, fixtures, local gates |
| `LOCATION_EXAMPLES.md`, `UNIPROT_ENUMS.md` | reference | Verified examples and source enumerations |

## Sources, storage and size

| Document | Kind | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `sources/registry.yaml` | living (source of truth) | Every resource: in use, evaluating, queued, deferred, rejected, retired, out of scope |
| `sources/README.md` | normative | How sources are proposed, triaged and decided |
| `DATA_SOURCES_STATUS.md` | living | Technical detail of each source in use |
| `SOURCE_COVERAGE.md` | living | Knowledge areas, the source rubric, and evaluations by wave (#83) |
| `SOURCE_ARCHITECTURE.md` | living | Declared enrichers, the runner and shared services for many sources (#86) |
| `sources/FIXTURE_DELIVERY.md` | normative | Reviewed recovery file delivery, protected local originals and explicit public/local pytest scopes |
| `sources/NATIVE_ACCESS_REFERENCE.md` | living | Source-specific native protocols, fields, observation and qualification limits |
| `sources/DEVELOPMENT_API.md` | living | Unpublished recovered source reader/mapping APIs |
| `STORAGE_LAYOUT.md` | living | Knowledge store, files, recommended project layout |
| `CACHE_POLICY.md` | living | What is stored and what is not, and open questions |
| `CARD_SIZE_RISKS.md` | living | Card growth, measurements, mitigations |
| `DOCS_GAPS.md` | living | What the user guide lacks |

## Working folders

- `pending_proposals/private_consumer_revalidation.md`: bounded live/editable
  consumer execution, exact saved readers and original-answer replay (#132),
  measured costs, implemented NCBI Taxonomy operation observation (#108) and the
  correction separating a pre-import memory counter from actual process sampling.
  Original content/results stay private; broader consumer acceptance remains open.
- `pending_proposals/comparative_response_contracts_checkpoint.json`: qualified
  source correction for malformed OMA/UniRef/gnomAD/GTEx responses (#137), public
  regressions, exact-SHA CI and shared editable-environment verification. This does
  not qualify a new installed artifact or complete comparative operation coverage.
- `pending_proposals/post_recovery_public_checkpoint.md`: authorized code delivery,
  exact-SHA CI and private-consumer revalidation scheduling (#112/#132), with its
  [machine-readable receipt](pending_proposals/post_recovery_public_checkpoint.json).
- `pending_proposals/post_recovery_consolidation.md`: implemented input-delivery
  boundaries, guide restructuring, generated capability scope, protein residue
  integration, measured costs and owner-local consumer coordination (#112).
- `pending_proposals/post_recovery_global_audit.md`: architectural alignment,
  measured source expansion and the proposed consolidation/delivery acceptance
  after stash closure (#112). This distinguishes useful native access from complete
  scientific journeys and preserves the approved development order.
- `pending_proposals/historical_provider_reactivation.md`: seven recovered sources
  deferred after complete actionability review (#83/#95). Each has an explicit
  reactivation trigger and native requirements preserved independently of the stash.
  This does not add active implementation work without new input/access.
- `pending_bugs/`, `pending_proposals/`: analyses of active issues, each tied to its
  issue.
  `pending_proposals/design_implementation_review.md` compares original design,
  scientific capabilities and current implementation, with concrete gaps and owning
  acceptance criteria (#112). Its
  [quality completion proposal](pending_proposals/design_implementation_review.md#quality-completion-proposal-2026-10-09-112)
  records the accepted bounded inspection, explanation, literature, cost and delivery acceptance
  within the approved roadmap.
  Development comparative explanations and their standalone public
  `examples/user_journeys/comparative_support.py` reader retain exact sequence and
  tissue support (#91). Development scoped tissue rules correct historical limits under #138;
  [their scope](pending_proposals/comparative_tissue_scope.md) preserves explicit legacy rules and reports;
  operation/bibliography coverage is still #108.
  The [scoped tissue source receipt](pending_proposals/comparative_tissue_scope_checkpoint.json)
  records code `3bc1c53`, 5,819 local-original cases, explicit legacy reproduction,
  schema 0.3.14 migration/refresh and 15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs. Broader declared-source
  refresh routing now uses the declarations and preserves recorded request arguments
  under #139; [its scope](pending_proposals/refresh_request_scope.md) and
  [source receipt](pending_proposals/refresh_request_scope_checkpoint.json) record
  code `ff32cb6`, 5,896 local-original cases and 15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs.
  Comparative observation/bibliography #108 follows this correction.
  The [development GTEx slice](pending_proposals/gtex_observation.md) adds actual
  tissue access, requested-label/revision distinctions and original portable
  resource credit; 34 new regressions and 5,930 local-original cases pass at
  `2b5db53`, with 15/15 exact-SHA CI and governance. The
  [source receipt](pending_proposals/gtex_observation_checkpoint.json) also records
  4,377 cases per public offline lane and 1,015 per public-Ackredit lane.
  [Development UniRef observation](pending_proposals/uniref_observation.md) now
  retains page releases, caps, partial failures and portable resource credit;
  code `c6cb0e3` passes 5,963 local-original cases and 15/15 exact-SHA CI.
  [Its source receipt](pending_proposals/uniref_observation_checkpoint.json) preserves
  public/installed compatibility scopes. The [pagination correction #140](archive/uniref_pagination.md) is
  source-qualified at `3a47490`: 21 new cases, 5,984 local-original cases and 15/15
  exact-source CI; [its receipt](archive/uniref_pagination_checkpoint.json) retains
  the public/installed compatibility scopes. The [OMA slice](pending_proposals/oma_observation.md)
  is source-qualified at `593ba76`: 47 new cases, 6,031 local-original cases and
  15/15 exact-source CI; [its receipt](pending_proposals/oma_observation_checkpoint.json)
  retains public/installed compatibility and original-answer replay scope.
  The [gnomAD slice](pending_proposals/gnomad_observation.md) is source-qualified
  at `682e226`, including unqueried gene prerequisites (#141): 54 new cases,
  6,085 local-original tests and 15/15 exact-source CI;
  [its receipt](pending_proposals/gnomad_observation_checkpoint.json) retains
  public/installed compatibility and original-answer replay scope.
  [Open Targets prerequisite #142](pending_bugs/open_targets_prerequisite.md) is
  implemented with source qualification in progress. Audit the remaining legacy
  prerequisite gates (#143), then advance derived comparative operations and
  complete bibliography #108.
  The [comparative explanation receipt](pending_proposals/comparative_explanations_checkpoint.json)
  records code `3fa2fdf`, 5,768 local-original cases, 45 new regressions and
  15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs. It qualifies development source, with installed delivery
  and human usefulness review remaining separate.
  `pending_proposals/independent_user_journeys.md` scopes the three standalone SDK
  journeys, the implemented protein comparison, molecule/target and bounded disease
  examples, exact disease membership support, conservative whole-context admission
  and remaining filtering by terms of use, clinical, query and observation gaps
  (#112, #29/#91/#71/#108). The source-state
  correction is delivered in qualified 0.14.0 under versioned rules (#122).
  `pending_proposals/ackredit_knowledge_pipeline_attribution.md` records the required
  pipeline attribution plan (#108, moli#36), its automatic composition and bounded
  acquisition adapters (including development ClinicalTrials.gov native references
  and explicit Europe PMC bibliography), and remaining coverage/publication gates.
- `templates/report.md`: the report template (MOLI reporting protocol).
- `archive/`: resolved reports and superseded documents, indexed in
  `archive/README.md`. The original plans are there, and `ROADMAP.md` still tracks them.

## Keeping the guide true

- A change that makes a line false updates it in the same commit. This applies to
  `CHECKPOINT.md`, `PUBLIC_API.md`, `FIELD_PATHS.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, `TESTS.md` and the
  registry.
- A decision goes to `DECISIONS.md`. A possible future problem goes to
  `RISKS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, with an issue when it needs a decision later.
- Each release reviews `ROADMAP.md` against both routes, and updates `CHECKPOINT.md`.
- A superseded document is archived with a note that says what replaced it, never
  deleted.
- Public documents never carry confidential pilot content; pilot needs are phrased
  generically.
