# Sabueso — Canonical Field Paths

This document defines the **canonical field paths** for Sabueso cards. These are the
paths used by mappings, resolver rules, SourceAssertions, and downstream tools.

Versioning: **x.y.z** (no leading `v`).

---

## 1) Global Base Paths (all card types)

### meta.*
- `meta.card_id`
- `meta.schema_version`
- `meta.entity_type`
- `meta.created_at`
- `meta.updated_at`
- `meta.sources`

### identifiers.*
- `identifiers.uniprot`
- `identifiers.pdb`
- `identifiers.chembl`
- `identifiers.pubchem`
- `identifiers.drugbank`
- `identifiers.inchi`
- `identifiers.inchikey`
- `identifiers.smiles` (isomeric: keeps stereochemistry where the source defines it)
- `identifiers.smiles_connectivity` (connectivity only, no stereochemistry)
- `identifiers.gene_loci` (list of `{database, id}`: gene loci in organism databases, e.g. `{"database": "TriTrypDB", "id": "TcCLB.508647.200"}` from UniProt's VEuPathDB cross-references, and `{"database": "NCBI Gene", "id": "7167"}`; identity anchors that tell paralogs apart, #54)
- `identifiers.other` (list/dict for rare IDs)

### names.*
- `names.canonical_name` (UniProt's recommended name; an unreviewed entry without one gives its first submission name, with `source_metadata.uniprot_name: submission`)
- `names.synonyms` (list of `{name, kind}`; UniProt's alternative names, `kind: alternative_name`, and the submitter's other names, `submission_name`; curatable as `{name}`: a name a publication uses for the entry, which anchors resolution by name through a curation store, #55. A curated `{name}` that UniProt states corroborates it: `kind` describes the item, it does not state it)
- `names.abbreviations` (list of `{name, of}`; UniProt's short names, with the full name each shortens)
- `names.gene_names` (list of `{name, kind, gene}`; UniProt's gene names, `kind` one of `gene_name`, `synonym`, `ordered_locus`, `orf`; `gene` numbers the gene within the entry, since an entry can be encoded by several)

### properties.*
- `properties.physchem.formula`
- `properties.physchem.molecular_weight` (quantity node, `dalton`)
- `properties.physchem.logp`
- `properties.physchem.tpsa` (quantity node, `angstrom ** 2`)

- `annotations.tissue_specificity`
- `annotations.organism`
- `annotations.taxon_id` (NCBI taxonomy id; strain-level when the entry is, #54)
- `annotations.lineage` (list of taxon names from the root down, the organism itself excluded, as UniProt states it, #54)
- `annotations.taxonomy` (`{tax_id, name, rank, ancestors: [{tax_id, name, rank}]}` from NCBI Taxonomy: ranks and ancestor ids, root first; opt-in enrichment `taxonomy=True`, #67)
- `annotations.ptm`
- `annotations.polymorphism`
- `annotations.domains` (non-positional summary; reserved, not currently produced)

### literature.*

### features_positional.*
- `features_positional.domains` (positional domains)
- `features_positional.active_site`
- `features_positional.binding_site`

- `features_positional.modified_residue`
- `features_positional.disulfide_bond`
- `features_positional.natural_variant` (a variant observed in a population: substitution, verbatim description, `VAR_` id, dbSNP)
- `features_positional.mutagenesis` (a substitution the authors made, with the effect they report)
- `features_positional.alternative_sequence` (the segment an isoform replaces or lacks: substitution, verbatim description, `VSP_` id, and the `isoform_ids` the entry links to it; #80)
- `features_positional.secondary_structure` (UniProt's helix, strand and turn segments: `element`, and the `structures` each segment was read from, e.g. `pdb:9F69`; #80)
- A `substitution` with `missing: true` is a deletion (UniProt's "Missing"), in variants, mutagenesis and alternative sequences (since 0.3.6).
- `features_positional.glycosylation`

### quantities.*
The seal over every quantity node of a stored card (uibcdf/sabueso#32):
- `quantities.*` (PyUnitWizard QuantityRecordBundle; one column per path and unit)

### quality.*

- `quality.literature_extractions` (unpublished 0.3.12: scientific intake identity,
  named intake/extraction rules, subject/publication, locator/input hash, original
  assertion and relationship IDs, and unknown fragment terms; runtime records remain
  separate)

- `identifiers.ensembl_transcripts` (UniProt's Ensembl cross-references: `{transcript, protein?, gene?, isoform?}`, `transcript` versioned as UniProt states it, `isoform` when UniProt names the isoform it encodes; read by `Card.isoform_tissue_usage()`; since 0.3.10, #102)
- `annotations.tissue_terms` (GTEx, for each tissue the card's pext names: `{gtex_id, name, tissue_site?, ontology_id, ontology_iri?}`, the term UBERON or EFO as GTEx states it; joined to the pext's tissues by `gtex_tissue_key@1`; since 0.3.10, #102)

---

## 3) PeptideCard Extensions

- Same as ProteinCard, but may omit `structure.*` if not available.

---

## 4) SmallMoleculeCard Extensions

- `identifiers.chebi` (`CHEBI:<n>`, since 0.3.8, #83): the ChEBI entry UniChem links and whose stated InChIKey is the anchor
- `annotations.drug_class`
- `annotations.chemical_classes` (since 0.3.8): list of `{chebi_id, name}`, the classes ChEBI says the molecule is a member of (`is a`)
- `annotations.chemical_roles` (since 0.3.8): list of `{chebi_id, name, direct, biological_role, chemical_role, application}`; `direct` roles are the entry's own `has role` statements, the others ChEBI classifies it with through its classes or parent roles
- `annotations.definition` (since 0.3.8): `{text}`, ChEBI's definition; the assertion keeps its markup, the value is its plain text
- `clinical.*` (same keys as base)

---

## 5) DiseaseCard Extensions (#90, since 0.3.7)

Anchored at a MONDO term (`sabueso:disease:mondo:MONDO:0014221`).

- `identifiers.mondo` (the MONDO id)
- `identifiers.equivalent_ids` (list of the ids MONDO states are the same disease, `MONDO:equivalentTo`, e.g. `DOID:0050884`, `Orphanet:868`, `OMIM:615512`; the only ids that join other sources' diseases to the card)
- `identifiers.related_ids` (list of MONDO's other xrefs: related terms, never identity)
- `annotations.definition` (`{text, references}`, as MONDO states it)
- `annotations.disease_subsets` (list of MONDO subsets the term is in, e.g. `rare`)
- `names.canonical_name` and `names.synonyms` (`{name, kind}`, kind `exact_synonym`, `related_synonym`, `broad_synonym` or `narrow_synonym`) are shared with the base paths.
- Parents are `subclass_of` relationships (disease → `mondo:<id>`).

---

## Notes
- Since card schema 0.3.11 (frozen for the 0.12.0 candidate), `mentioned_in` optionally carries
  `qualifiers.article` (native article identifiers) and `qualifiers.locations[]`
  (`annotation`, unchanged from Europe PMC, and `source_assertion_id`). Each occurrence
  has its own SourceAssertion; its `source_metadata.identity_basis` records the
  printed accession and matching UniProt tag. These are relationship qualifiers,
  not section field paths. `quality.enrichments` records explicit `article_ids`,
  `data: located_accession_annotations`, `annotation_count` and `returned_annotations`.
- The same frozen candidate schema adds derived `structure_mentioned_in` relationships
  (protein → publication, one per `structure_ref`), with `article`, `locations`,
  `structure_ref` and `structure_context` qualifiers. Context records `protein_ref`,
  `structure_ref`, structural `relationship_ids`, supporting `source_assertion_ids`
  and `scope: entry_association`. Raw PDB mention assertions use
  `relationships.mentioned_in` with a PDB subject and `stated_pdb_accession` identity
  basis. Rule `structure_mention_context@1` retains both legs; it never creates an
  assertion for the derived protein link. Enrichment records add
  `mapping: located_accession_mapping@2`, `uniprot_mention_count`,
  `structure_mention_count`, `uniprot_annotation_count`, `pdb_annotation_count`, and
  `unlinked_pdb_mentions[]` (`structure_ref`, native `annotation_id`, `reason`).
  `Card.literature()` adds `structure_mentions` only to publications with these
  links, keeping context, locations, support, derivation and qualifier alternatives.
- GO annotations, family/domain classifications, curated interactions and experimental
  structures are **relationships**, not field paths: `annotated_with`, `classified_in`,
  `interacts_with` and `has_structure` (see the Relationship contract in `SCHEMA.md`).
- `annotations.domains` and `features_positional.domains` are both valid.
- If only positional data exists, populate `features_positional.domains`.
- If only non-positional data exists, populate `annotations.domains`.
- If both exist, keep both.
