# Sabueso — Checkpoint

Current state and resumption guidance. Historical receipts belong to the
[archive](archive/README.md); development order belongs to [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
Last updated: 2026-10-10, GTEx tissue observation source-qualified (#108).

The [development GTEx observation slice](pending_proposals/gtex_observation.md)
records existing tissue access and portable attribution, distinguishes requested
dataset labels from unknown native revisions, and classifies missing local files
as unavailable. 34 new regressions, 343 selected cases and 5,930 local-original
cases pass with twelve receptor workers. Source `2b5db53` passes
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38038383487)
and [governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38038383380). The
[source receipt](pending_proposals/gtex_observation_checkpoint.json) retains 4,377
cases per public offline lane, 1,015 per installed public-Ackredit lane, 76 post-editable
cases and independently verified full receptor captures. #108 stays open for
UniRef, OMA, gnomAD and derived comparative operations. Published 0.14.0 is unchanged.

Development refresh now uses all 24 declared enrichers' 25 source/data selectors,
preserves supplied protein request options on every recorded outcome, and reports
historical unrecorded parameters, explicit overrides and unsupported selectors.
Conflicting or missing essential known-route parameters require an explicit override
before acquisition. `store=` retains original and refreshed pins. Unpublished
schema 0.3.14 adds optional quality records; published 0.3.13 stays unchanged.
[Refresh scope and limits](pending_proposals/refresh_request_scope.md).
Code `ff32cb684904910dcd4051def95ebba06120a256` passes
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38034709963)
and [governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38034709969).
The [source receipt](pending_proposals/refresh_request_scope_checkpoint.json)
records 77 new regressions, 273 selected and 5,896 full local-original cases with
twelve receptor workers on Python 3.14.7. All nine public offline CI lanes pass
4,343 cases with ten declared fixture skips; four installed public-Ackredit lanes
pass 981 cases. 116 refresh/migration/independent-report cases pass after updating
editable metadata; all six participating imports are verified outside the checkout.
With explicit maintainer authorization, the receipt publishes aggregate #132
revalidation metrics: eight existing cells, five refreshes and ten exact
original/refreshed pins; the independent reader verifies 9,094 sealed assertions
and 30 individual pinned reads with unchanged active-session credit. No new
provider query or original cell is involved. Detailed consumer artifacts remain
private; installed-artifact and human scientific acceptance stay separate.

Development Card views default to `pext_at_variant@2` and `isoform_exon_usage@3`,
with explanation `@2`, explicit historical `usage_rule` selection and per-tissue
resolved/missing/conflicting coverage. Overlapping bases count once and incompatible
or missing genomic scopes do not establish correspondence. Unpublished schema
0.3.14 adds requested-reference-genome context to new gnomAD variant assertions;
migration reports missing context instead of inferring it. Recorded gnomAD
variant/pext options and limits are restored during refresh. Both public report
generations have inert readers and format-preserving reacquisition.

Earlier tissue-scope code `3bc1c53150e8743cdee5132a915d4aa19cf6d0d1` passes
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38031754778)
and [governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/38031754777).
The [source receipt](pending_proposals/comparative_tissue_scope_checkpoint.json)
records 41 new scoped regressions, ten additional independent-format cases,
187 selected and 5,819 full local-original cases with twelve workers. All nine
public offline CI lanes pass 4,266 cases with ten declared fixture skips; four
Ackredit compatibility lanes pass 981 cases. Shared editable imports/metadata and
archived native-answer/old-report revalidation pass without new provider queries.
[Correction scope](pending_proposals/comparative_tissue_scope.md).

Earlier `@1` explanation qualification at `3fa2fdf` retains its unchanged
[receipt](pending_proposals/comparative_explanations_checkpoint.json). Published
0.14.0, frozen 0.3.13 and stored historical reports remain unchanged.
Next: remaining UniRef/OMA/gnomAD and derived comparative operation/bibliography
observation #108; GTEx is qualified above. Installed
artifact qualification and human scientific acceptance remain separate.

## Resume here

The maintainer authorized the consolidation order in the
[global audit](pending_proposals/post_recovery_global_audit.md): fixture delivery,
guide structure, explicit source maturity, bounded scientific journeys and parallel
consumer coordination. Keep the approved foundational and pilot-driven routes.

| Work | Current state | Next acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixture delivery | 50 repository entries, including the release compatibility card; 37 protected local originals; public absence suite passes with originals restored and verified | Requalification of local delivery only with applicable declarations; retain both test scopes |
| Guide | Six complete entry-document snapshots archived; common guidance separated from provider details; warning-failing Sphinx passes | Keep current guidance true alongside the next implementation |
| Source maturity | Generated native/mapping/enricher/input scope; 83 `in_use`, 37 deferred, 11 evaluating; 24 declared enricher instances | Integration by scientific question; portfolio-wide live health and consumer acceptance remain unassessed |
| Scientific journeys | Protein example `@2` retains active-site residue/composition support; independent legacy reader and reacquisition pass | Next bounded clinical bibliography/query/explanation work; complete derived-operation observation remains open |
| Consumers | Bounded editable native-answer routes have independent saved readers and exact-build replay; fixture-only orchestration retains its separate scope; ready MOLI correction in PR #65; Nextia #1 retains Evidence ownership | Installed-artifact and human scientific acceptance remain open under #132; unasked source profiles and historical missing stores remain unqualified |
| SQLite lifetime | Card/deck readers and writers and direct test queries close connections; eight regressions and 5,602 local-original cases pass; exact-SHA CI passes 15/15 with no SQLite warning group (#133) | Keep fatal Linux Python 3.14 guards; correction is on development main, outside the published 0.14.0 artifact |
| Dependent source requests | GTEx missing tissue/release prerequisites are `not_queried`; the runner stops before constructing a client; 113 selected and 5,605 full local-original cases pass; code `b28f8d3` passes 15/15 CI and governance (#135) | Retain unknown counts and historical source/report support; qualify a future installed artifact separately |
| Shared source terms | UniRef explicitly shares canonical `uniprot` terms; collisions and policy differences are refused; 125 selected and 5,627 full local-original cases pass; code `e0b80b2` passes 15/15 CI and governance (#136) | Retain historical reports; qualify a future installed artifact separately |
| Refresh requested scope | Declared selectors and recorded protein arguments survive failed/blocked/excluded requests; 77 new cases, 5,896 full local-original cases and exact-source CI 15/15 pass at `ff32cb6` (#139); original pins and scientific support remain readable | Historical unrecorded parameters use current defaults; unsupported routes are reported and omitted; all molecule/disease routes, comparative operation/bibliography #108 and installed/human acceptance remain separate |
| Comparative scientific scope | Default tissue rules and explanation versions check explicit genomic scope and resolved/missing/conflicting coverage; 41 scoped cases, both report generations and 5,819 local-original cases pass; code `3bc1c53` passes 15/15 CI and governance (#138) | Retain explicit legacy reproduction and missing historical coordinate context; declared-source refresh is delivered in #139; operation/bibliography #108 and installed/human acceptance remain separate |
| Comparative response integrity | Online OMA/UniRef/gnomAD/GTEx reject malformed required containers and unanswered consequence aliases; 96 new regressions, 223 selected and 5,723 full local-original cases pass; code `09cf912` passes 15/15 exact-SHA CI and governance (#137) | Retain declared source-version/operation gaps and qualify installed delivery separately; [source receipt](pending_proposals/comparative_response_contracts_checkpoint.json) |

The accumulated recovery/consolidation code checkpoint is published as
`dc4642414c46744f39d85cb666094b0d52dd705a`, with
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37838441204)
and [passing governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37838441190),
inspected with gh-run-receptor. The
[publication receipt](pending_proposals/post_recovery_public_checkpoint.md)
and [machine-readable record](pending_proposals/post_recovery_public_checkpoint.json)
retain both input scopes and the portability corrections. These preceding code
checkpoints remain historical; completed release qualification is recorded below.
Current scoped acceptance and measurements are in the
[consolidation report](pending_proposals/post_recovery_consolidation.md).
The [quality completion proposal](pending_proposals/design_implementation_review.md#quality-completion-proposal-2026-10-09-112)
defines remaining acceptance within the approved roadmap. Delivery tracking for
the seven bounded integrity defects #122–#128 is reconciled: qualified public
0.14.0 includes their regression modules in all twelve installed OS/Python lanes.
The broader #108/#112/#132 scopes remain open.
The [bounded consumer report](pending_proposals/private_consumer_revalidation.md)
records live versus replayed inputs, persisted support, measured costs and the
taxonomy observation follow-up and corrected memory measurement. Overall private workflow acceptance stays
open; no installed artifact or scientific Evidence is qualified by this exercise.
The follow-up code `a05e0a3132a43bf3a7bd53b94217db9690f39693` is published with
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37847914597)
and [passing governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37847914659),
inspected with gh-run-receptor. The [sanitized receipt](pending_proposals/taxonomy_followup_checkpoint.json)
retains local and remote scopes, measured cost correction and remaining limits.

## Release and schema

**Published release: 0.14.0**, qualified source/tag
`78623d0258c4deab5226ea39a96331c7b643dc44`, released 2026-10-09 (#134).
CI 37925885113 passes 15/15 and governance 37925885489 passes. The promoted
`sabueso-0.14.0-py_0.tar.bz2` has SHA-256
`ceb940bc37c85934ca0fadfdeb315cc69095aea46ed255d73b7c5f3e33376daa`.
All 12 installed Linux/macOS-arm64/Windows × Python 3.11–3.14 lanes pass
1,277 receiving cases, one intentional local-only input exclusion and the public
workflow. Clean public installation verifies bytes/origins/API, the frozen card,
the same cases, workflow and pip check. Zenodo
[10.5281/zenodo.23263488](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23263488) archives all
1,318 source files identical to the tag. Complete
[publication receipt](../devtools/conda-build/receipts/sabueso_0.14.0_public_2026-10-09.json).

Current development schema **0.3.14** is unpublished; published schema **0.3.13**, written by the clean installed preliminary Conda
candidate, and all earlier shapes/frozen cards remain immutable. The
[release notes](../devtools/conda-build/release_notes_0.14.0.md) define the
consolidation scope and remaining limits. Further shape changes follow
[SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md), migrations and recorded-shape gates.
Earlier release receipts remain in `../devtools/conda-build/receipts/`.

## Capabilities delivered in 0.14.0

The release consolidates bounded native/supplied-file access, explicit residue
and source-sequence context, notebook reports and public HK2, three independent
scientific journeys, clinical bibliography and conservative source-state/taxonomy
integrity. It advances both foundational support/identity/schema integrity and
bounded consumer-oriented workflows. Native access remains separate from declared
card contributions; complete private consumer acceptance (#132) and broader
acquisition/bibliography (#108) remain open. The released artifact retains the
SQLite lifetime behavior subsequently corrected and qualified on main under #133.

## Capabilities delivered in 0.13.0

Source-supported identity, conflict-preserving cards/decks, versioned derived views,
quantities, curation and pinned persistence form the established knowledge model.
0.13.0 adds broader required acquisition observation, original literal extraction
and explicit article bibliography, pinned derived explanations, integrity/count
corrections and a persisted application producer/reader/reuse exercise.
See [the public API](PUBLIC_API.md),
[release notes](../devtools/conda-build/release_notes_0.13.0.md) and
[design/implementation matrix](pending_proposals/design_implementation_review.md).

## Current development

The previously pushed post-release code checkpoint (`413cdf6`, followed by
`74c8c3d34299a59784b29937361be03da2c29640`) has
[15/15 exact-head CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37438528677)
and [passing governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37438528644).
It implements the three independent SDK journeys, molecular knowledge-state
correction, exact disease membership/build support and conservative admission,
additional source observations, ChEMBL indication references and explicit
ClinicalTrials.gov/Europe PMC observation/bibliography (#122–#128).
Those fixes and the recovered native/residue/sequence/report capabilities are
delivered in 0.14.0; the dated pre-release checkpoints remain historical.

The published development checkpoint adds bounded native-source readers/mappings, supplied original
snapshots, canonical residue/source-sequence knowledge and composition, isoform/
exact-sequence candidates, notebook reports and additional UniProt/PubChem/ChEBI
annotations. Source-specific subjects and revisions remain explicit. New native
access is not automatic card integration. Details:
[development API](PUBLIC_API.md#development-recovery-after-0130),
[native-access reference](sources/NATIVE_ACCESS_REFERENCE.md), and
[recovery closure](archive/local_work_2026-07/closure.json).

**Public test systems:** TcTIM/HsTIM and [HK2/P52789](HK2_TEST_SYSTEM.md).
HK2 rebuilds 239 SourceAssertions from its unchanged public UniProt fixture,
original acquisition 2026-09-23. It is UniProt-only; further native source inputs
are needed before claiming a multi-source HK2 card.

The 87 historical originals were reviewed and verified; the maintainer-authorized
stash deletion completed 2026-10-08. The stash list is empty. Historical cards,
notebooks and ligand hints are not current fixtures or confirmed knowledge.
Complete evidence stays in the [recovery archive](archive/local_work_2026-07/README.md).

## Package layout

- `core/`: cards/decks, assertions/relationships, selection, quantities, derived
  views, curation/extraction, packets, snapshots, stores and migration.
- `resolver/`: entity/field resolution and packaged selection/source metadata.
- `tools/db/`, `mappings/`, `enrichers/`: native access, transformation and declared
  card contributions, respectively; shared services remain in `tools/db/`.
- `tools/card/`, `tools/deck/` and other public tools: construction, storage,
  queries/navigation, source snapshots and notebook reports.
- `_private/`: ArgDigest argument digesters and SMonitor diagnostics.
- `schemas/`, `temp_data/`, `tests/`: schemas/shapes, declared fixtures/frozen cards,
  and scoped verification. Local-only originals are protected from Git delivery.
- `examples/`, `docs/`, `devguide/`: scientific SDK journeys, user documentation
  and maintained implementation/design guidance.
- `tools/`, `devtools/`: repository gates, build/release and governance tooling.

Core, resolver, native/public tools, mappings, enrichers and argument digesters
above are relative to `sabueso/`; schemas, fixtures, tests and documentation are
repository directories. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for semantic ownership.

## Quality baseline

Use editable Python **3.14.7** in **`molsyssuite@uibcdf_3.14`**, verified outside the
checkout. Sabueso's runtime requirements are satisfied in the shared development
environment; separately recorded Amber/preparation dependency conflicts remain
outside Sabueso's source behavior. Do not repair unrelated packages by changing
shared versions without their owner-local compatibility evidence.

Pre-consolidation full local checkpoint: **5,554 passed / 173.00 s**, ten expected
fixture warnings; architectural audit selected gate: **395 passed / 128.46 s**.
Those precede the explicit public/local input split and subsequent implementation.
Earlier consolidation gates and scope are recorded in the consolidation report.
Public input qualification passed **4,021 tests / 130.19 s**, ten explicit native
skips and ten expected warnings, with protected originals physically absent.
Full verified local-original qualification passed **5,574 tests / 164.11 s**,
ten expected warnings and no skips. Both scopes include all three independent
scientific journeys; complete receipts are in that report.
Final public checkpoint `dc46424` passes **5,576 local-original tests / 175.56 s**,
ten source-fixture warnings and no skips. Its nine remote repository-input lanes
each pass **4,023 tests**, ten native skips and 26 online deselections; four
installed public Ackredit receiving lanes each pass 965 cases. Git checkout-byte,
UTF-8 metadata and bounded pytest case-name regressions protect Windows validation;
notebook schema validation declares its `nbformat` test dependency. Linux Python
3.14.8 additionally reports 66 unclosed SQLite connection warnings tracked in
[#133](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/issues/133). See the publication receipt
for exact-SHA/platform results, warning scopes and qualification limits.
Local pytest uses **pytest-receptor and 12 workers**; exact remote CI inspection uses
gh-run-receptor when a code checkpoint is pushed. See [TESTS.md](TESTS.md).
The final taxonomy-operation/fixture-state follow-up passes **173 selected tests / 23.43 s** and
**5,592 full local-original tests / 196.16 s**, ten expected fixture warnings,
using the same environment/receptor/12 workers. Its nine remote repository-input
lanes each pass **4,039 tests**, ten native skips and 26 online deselections;
four installed public Ackredit 0.9.0 receiving lanes each pass **981 cases** and
the public workflow. Eight repository lanes report six expected fixture warnings;
Linux Python 3.14 reports those six plus **67 unclosed SQLite warnings** (#133).
The receiving lanes report two expected fixture warnings each. This qualifies the
exact follow-up code, not a new Sabueso release or overall private-pilot acceptance.

## Open work

The GTEx prerequisite correction (#135) passes **113 selected cases / 19.05 s**
and **5,605 full local-original cases / 148.22 s**, using Python 3.14.7,
pytest-receptor, 12 workers and the fatal SQLite/unraisable warning guards.
The ten full-suite warnings are intentional source-fixture outcomes. Ruff,
source/fixture registry, unchanged schema 0.3.13 shape, governance and warning-failing
Sphinx gates pass. Code `b28f8d39760515026ed3ec7ab80d977ff1f2a3f4` passes
**15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs** and governance: nine repository-input lanes on Linux,
macOS arm64 and Windows pass **4,052 cases**, with ten protected-input skips,
26 online deselections and six intentional fixture warnings each. The four
installed-Ackredit receiving lanes pass **981 cases** each. GH Run Receptor full
capture/replay verifies the result. See the
[technical receipt](pending_proposals/gtex_prerequisite_checkpoint.json).
The published 0.14.0 artifact and historical stored cards/reports are unchanged.

The shared-source attribution collision (#136) is corrected in code `e0b80b2`: UniRef
declares `terms.shared_with: uniprot`, both records retain identical canonical
policy, and the export refuses undeclared owners, differing policies and invalid
references. A UniProtKB-only card credits the UniProt Consortium without implying
UniRef access. **125 selected cases / 16.10 s** and **5,627 full local-original
cases / 156.62 s** pass on Python 3.14.7 with pytest-receptor, 12 workers and fatal
SQLite/unraisable warning guards. Five public UniProt fixture declarations were
requalified for the attribution-only fingerprint; original bytes, licences,
statement/review dates and delivery decisions remain fixed. Ruff, registry,
fixture delivery, governance and warning-fatal Sphinx pass. Source
`e0b80b2f3996419bda1909e1bc0a52ff0c6263f6` passes
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37996066614)
and [governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37996066521).
Nine repository-input lanes pass **4,074 cases** each, with ten protected-input
skips, 26 online deselections and six intentional fixture warnings. Four
installed-Ackredit receiving lanes pass **981 cases** each. GH Run Receptor full
capture/replay verifies the result; see the
[technical receipt](pending_proposals/shared_source_terms_checkpoint.json).
This correction does not establish a licence change; preserved reports remain
historical and the published 0.14.0 artifact remains unchanged.

Follow the [immediate resumption sequence](ROADMAP.md#immediate-resumption-sequence).
The recovered checkpoint's CI is qualified. Bounded private MOLI consumer
revalidation under [#132](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/issues/132) now passes
14 original cells, exact saved-state reading and original-answer replay.
The exercised NCBI Taxonomy acquisition-operation gap under
[#108](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/issues/108) is implemented and rechecked
in live/replayed private scope, with original scientific content retained.
Its exact-SHA CI is qualified; extend the existing consumer routes with declared
source scope before broadening sources or APIs. The previously reported 942 MiB
counter predates SDK imports; matched Linux sampling shows 132/129 MiB live/replay
with profiler overhead, rather than a new 942 MiB SDK allocation.
Keep their checkout read-only and their content/results private. Broad profiles,
full packet acquisition, unavailable historical pins and overall acceptance remain
unqualified; see the [bounded report](pending_proposals/private_consumer_revalidation.md).
Fourteen additional original cards/inventory cells pass through an explicitly
injected repository-fixture transport, with zero network attempts or warnings.
This adds orchestration coverage only: synthetic/cut fixtures and missing local
answers do not establish current source health, absence or full pilot acceptance.
Original inputs and the read-only pilot checkout remain unchanged. See the
[fixture follow-up](pending_proposals/private_consumer_revalidation.md#structural-fixture-orchestration-follow-up).

The post-release SQLite fix (#133) explicitly closes legacy card/deck connections
after their transaction exits and closes direct test queries. Allocation traces
identify those owners; the KnowledgeStore and retrieval archive already close
their sessions. Eight regressions fail on the earlier lifetime and pass with the
fix, including empty/error reads and failed deck-replacement rollback. Full
local-original qualification passes **5,602 cases / 189.81 s**, 12 workers and
pytest-receptor, with ten intentional fixture warnings. Unclosed-database and
unraisable-exception warnings are fatal in this checkpoint and in Linux Python
3.14 CI. Code `5bbede0253992eaef96048ea20cd3f427d6686ad` passes
[15/15 exact-SHA CI jobs](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37976990044)
and [1/1 governance](https://github.com/uibcdf/sabueso/actions/runs/37976990029),
inspected with GH Run Receptor full captures. Nine repository-input lanes each
pass 4,049 cases, ten native-only skips and 26 online deselections; four installed
public Ackredit receiving lanes pass 981 cases and their public workflows.
Linux Python 3.14.8 now has six intentional fixture warnings, with the former
67 unclosed SQLite warnings absent. #133 is complete; this is not a new release.
See the [sanitized checkpoint](pending_proposals/sqlite_lifetime_checkpoint.json).

Independent SDK acceptance remains useful while consumer-owned work proceeds.
Queries/non-protein packets (#71), derived explanations (#91), complete observed
pipeline/bibliography (#108), finer use-term filtering (#29), peptide identity
and selected source integration remain bounded open work. Seven deferred recovered
providers have [explicit reactivation conditions](pending_proposals/historical_provider_reactivation.md).
Release qualification follows [the staged route](../devtools/conda-build/README.md).

## Release qualification

Published receipts prove only their exact source and artifact. The recovered code
checkpoint and taxonomy follow-up were qualified at `dc46424` and `a05e0a3`;
0.14.0 qualifies their accumulated release at `78623d0`. Subsequent code revisions need their own
applicable gates and exact-SHA CI. Staged installed-package/platform gates remain
required before release.
Older diagnostic wheels, local native inputs and historical pilot execution are
not qualification of a new release or private-consumer acceptance. See
[the audit](pending_proposals/post_recovery_global_audit.md).
