# Sabueso — Next Steps

## Immediate
1) Integrate Resolver into the card-building pipeline (mapping → evidences → resolver → Card).
2) Confirm the final list of canonical field paths.
3) Define a stable field‑path naming convention for rules and evidence objects.

## Short Term
4) Decide how to represent `location` for positional features (range model).
5) Draft database module interfaces (input/output contracts).
6) Implement evidence-driven aggregator for a minimal subset of fields.

## Medium Term
7) Add caching strategy and local storage format.
8) Expand mappings only after Resolver integration is stable.
