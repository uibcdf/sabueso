# Sabueso — Next Steps

## Immediate
1) Confirm the final list of canonical field paths.
2) Define a stable field‑path naming convention for rules and evidence objects.
3) Decide how to represent `location` for positional features (range model).
4) Establish the Phase‑0 repository layout (core, resolver, tools, ops, mappings, docs, tests).

## Short Term
5) Draft database module interfaces (input/output contracts).
6) Implement UniProt database module prototype and evidence extraction.
7) Implement PDB database module prototype and evidence extraction.

## Medium Term
7) Implement aggregator for at least ProteinCard.
8) Implement selection rules for a minimal subset of fields.
9) Add caching strategy and local storage format.
