# Sabueso — Next Steps

## Immediate
1) Implement Resolver 0.1.0 (selection rules + conflict recording).
2) Add unit tests for Resolver selection behavior.
3) Confirm the final list of canonical field paths.
4) Define a stable field‑path naming convention for rules and evidence objects.

## Short Term
5) Decide how to represent `location` for positional features (range model).
6) Draft database module interfaces (input/output contracts).
7) Implement evidence-driven aggregator for a minimal subset of fields.

## Medium Term
8) Add caching strategy and local storage format.
9) Expand mappings only after Resolver tests are stable.
