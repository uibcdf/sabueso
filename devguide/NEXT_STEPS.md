# Sabueso — Next Steps

## Immediate
1) Decide cache/storage policy (raw vs cards vs both) and document it.
2) Define a stable field‑path naming convention for rules and evidence objects.

## Short Term
3) Decide how to represent `location` for positional features (range model).
5) Draft database module interfaces (input/output contracts).
6) Extend resolver integration with end-to-end Card construction (real sources).

## Medium Term
7) Add caching strategy and local storage format.
8) Expand mappings only after Resolver integration is stable.
