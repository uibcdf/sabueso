# Sabueso — Tests and Quality Gates

Select verification by changed behavior and state its scope. Detailed provider
cases are in [the native test reference](sources/NATIVE_TEST_REFERENCE.md); dated
receipts remain [archived](archive/consolidation_2026-10-08/TESTS.md). A passing
source test does not complete a scientific journey, consumer contract or release.

## Running the tests

Use Python 3.14 in the existing editable `molsyssuite@uibcdf_3.14` environment.
Install Sabueso and participating installable workspace packages from their local
checkouts with `python -m pip install --no-deps --editable .`. Verify editable
metadata and import paths outside the checkout. Keep installed-artifact
qualification separate from workspace development.

Public/repository-input offline suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -n 12 -m "not online" --receptor=llm
```

Full local suite including verified unshared native originals:

```bash
python -m pytest -n 12 -m "not online" --receptor=llm --local-source-inputs
```

The default excludes 25 native-only modules before import and explicitly skips
ten mixed native cases. Synthetic binding/malformed-input and public sequence-axis
tests remain active. The local option verifies original digests and includes that
coverage; unavailable or changed originals fail before collection. See the exact
[fixture delivery scope](sources/FIXTURE_DELIVERY.md). Test counts must identify
which command ran. Historical 5,554-case receipts precede this separation.

For a smaller changed scope, append its individual test paths. A private pilot
execution, an online test and a public fixture replay are different acceptance
routes. Run online tests only for an authorized concrete source/use scope; a
fixture does not establish current live availability.

## Test kinds

- Unit/contract tests verify errors, identities, assertion support, quantities and
  transformations, including deliberately synthetic parser inputs.
- Native response tests preserve qualified original wire/file content and scopes.
- Integration tests combine resolution, cards/decks, packets, persistence and
  original runtime/bibliography sidecars.
- Independent-user tests exercise separate producer, inert reader and reacquisition
  processes outside the checkout with exact original support.
- Installed-artifact tests establish the behavior and complete dependency closure
  of the exact built/published package, independent of workspace imports.

Core filenames in the table are relative to `tests/core/` unless another directory
is stated. Broaden the selected scope when changes affect shared contracts, schemas
or multiple routes. The full offline suite is a code checkpoint; it is not required
for every documentation-only or exploratory change.

## Clinical registry and bibliography guards in development

Native ClinicalTrials.gov study/reference observation, exact integrity, explicit
Europe PMC bibliography and collective authors preserve separate requested scopes,
original sidecars, missing/failed/unqueried states and publication pointers. The
[clinical report](pending_proposals/clinical_registry_checkpoint.md) records its
receipts; complete clinical breadth and bibliography remain #108 work. When this
slice enters a journey, test independent reading and reacquisition without adding
credit or following unasked links.

## Traceability and extraction guards delivered in 0.13.0

Per-source acquisition cases cover native bytes, query/time/version bases,
empty/failure/reuse/retries/cuts and detached traces. Attribution, extraction,
article metadata, pinned explanation and persisted-pipeline cases retain original
scientific support separately from observed execution and bibliography. Saved
readers forbid source access, derivation and new credit. Source-specific coverage
and the detailed delivered cases remain in the archived test descriptions and
[SOURCE_ACCESS.md](SOURCE_ACCESS.md).

## Independent-user journey acceptance (#112, after 0.13.0)

The [journey acceptance report](pending_proposals/independent_user_journeys.md)
records protein/comparator, molecule/activity and bounded disease/entity behavior.
Examples live in `examples/user_journeys/`; regression tests run producers/readers/
reacquisition in independent processes and reject modified or misbound artifacts.
Original reports preserve their named format/rules and gaps. A current reader must
not silently recompute an old report under new rules.

Public TcTIM/HsTIM/HK2 inputs provide generic acceptance without private program
content. Real consumer-owned Evidence, modeling and shared Recorda interpretation
remain independent owner-local integration work; stand-in consumers cannot close
those contracts.

## Fixtures

Frozen public source responses keep their own declarations in `temp_data/NOTICE.md`.
No private/pilot data enters fixtures. Preserve source, date, applicable licence,
native revision basis and modifications. Code MIT does not license source data.

The reviewed recovery inventory records repository versus local-only file delivery.
Local-only originals are ignored and rejected from the Git index by the delivery
gate; they remain available for explicit local native qualification. New fixtures
need reviewed file decisions; changed bytes or source terms invalidate an old
receipt. Unknown permission never becomes permission through a successful test.

## Local checks and CI checkpoints

Run each applicable gate separately and read its result:

```bash
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
python tools/fixture_delivery.py --check
python -m pytest -n 12 -m "not online" --receptor=llm
python tools/card_shape.py
python tools/source_registry.py --check
python tools/validate_schema.py
python devtools/moli_governance.py
python devtools/dependency_preflight.py
```

When local native source code changes, include its explicit qualification selectors
and a full local checkpoint as appropriate. Public CI validates its available
repository-input scope; retain local-original receipts separately. Do not pipe a
gate through `tail`/`grep` or chain a commit after a command whose exit code does not
reflect the gate.

Linux Python 3.14 CI promotes unclosed-database ResourceWarnings and pytest
unraisable-exception warnings to errors (#133). The connection context manages
transactions, not lifetime: SQLite readers/writers use `closing` around it, and
direct test queries also close their handles. For a local checkpoint use
`-W "error:unclosed database:ResourceWarning"` and
`-W error::pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning`; unrelated ResourceWarnings
are not suppressed or promoted by the database-specific filter.

Documentation/evidence changes need applicable link/example/generated-content
checks. When `docs/` or a docstring changes, build with warnings fatal:

```bash
sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs <output directory>
```

Use the provisioned docs dependencies with the checkout installed. Nitpicky `-n`
is additional qualification; unresolved references from that run are not a passing
nitpicky receipt. Source shape and published frozen-card gates remain separate.

Batch short exploratory commits locally when remote visibility is unnecessary.
`[skip ci]` is allowed only for locally checked documentation/evidence direct pushes
with no executable, packaging or test-input effect. Code checkpoints use an
unskipped push and exact-SHA CI inspection through gh-run-receptor. GitHub's
conclusions remain authoritative; native `gh run view` is the fallback. Skipped or
older runs are not current validation. Source/data delivery must pass before a
public checkpoint, then [staged installed-package gates](../devtools/conda-build/README.md)
qualify releases across the required OS/minor matrix.

## Quality rules for knowledge

- Every selected value retains supporting SourceAssertions; selection preserves
  alternatives and conflicts. Relationships retain their exact assertion support.
- Physical quantities keep `{value, unit}` and verified seals through boundaries.
- Derived classes/groups/states/findings carry named versioned rules and are never
  stored as SourceAssertions.
- Identity merging requires source-stated correspondence; equal names, sequences
  or residue numbers are insufficient.
- Missing, failed, unasked, unavailable and source-stated absence remain distinct.
- Every pin returns its original verified state or fails; it never falls back to
  a newer state. Independent saved readers add no acquisition or credit.
- Each receipt identifies code/artifact, input scope, environment and applicable
  limits; a local diagnostic wheel is not a public release.
