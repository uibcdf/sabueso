# Test fixtures: sources, versions and licences

This directory contains **frozen public database responses** and compatibility
records built from them. Published fixtures are redistributed with Sabueso so its
offline tests are reproducible. Development artifacts explicitly marked local and
unreleased below have not been qualified for public redistribution; their exact
file set and applicable terms require review before a public repository checkpoint.
Public acquisition alone does not qualify redistribution. Each source's data keeps
its own terms below.

Sabueso's code is MIT licensed (`LICENSE`). That licence does **not** apply to these
files: each keeps the licence of the source it came from, listed below. A repository
holding both is a collection of separately licensed works.

These files are not included in the Python distribution (the wheel and sdist ship only
the `sabueso` package). Published fixtures are distributed with the git repository;
the local unreleased qualification artifacts are a separate delivery scope.

Where a fixture was trimmed to the fields the tests need, or wrapped in a small envelope
recording the release and retrieval time, it is a modified copy. It is redistributed
under the source's licence, and the modification is stated here and in the client that
wrote it (`sabueso/tools/db/`, `sabueso/resolver/`).

## Reviewed recovery inputs

The reviewed recovery file inventory is
[`devguide/sources/fixture_delivery.json`](../devguide/sources/fixture_delivery.json).
It records 49 repository-delivery inputs and 37 protected local-only originals,
with exact byte identities and file-specific decisions. `.gitignore` protects
the local input directories; `python tools/fixture_delivery.py --check` rejects
their inclusion in the Git index and checks the reviewed repository inputs.
Local originals retain their native content and notices. Their native regression
modules require pytest's explicit `--local-source-inputs` option; ordinary public
CI does not require or distribute those originals. Input-specific PRIDE and
OmniPath decisions do not license other records from those resources. DisProt's
original response remains local pending embedded-quotation rights qualification.
See [fixture delivery](../devguide/sources/FIXTURE_DELIVERY.md) for both test scopes.

## Local unreleased MEROPS qualification artifacts

The development `merops/` files below are held locally for reader qualification;
public fixture/repository redistribution is **not qualified**. This local recovery
has not been committed, pushed or packaged. MEROPS declares its complete database
content the Library under GNU Library GPL, with no stated version. The
[historical Library GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.txt)
section 0 distinguishes running a tool from distributing database-derived content;
[GNU GPL 3 section 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt), incorporated by the
currently linked LGPL, distinguishes unshared work from conveying it. These support
local unshared qualification; they do not select a provider version or qualify a
public derived dataset. Keep data and source notices separate from Sabueso's MIT code.

  GNU licence support files were received 2026-10-07. Their verbatim-copy permission
  applies to licence documents, not to arbitrary MEROPS data redistribution.

Credit MEROPS, EMBL-EBI and original contributing data providers. The normalized
`GNU-LIBRARY-GPL-UNVERSIONED` declaration preserves the stated licence; automated
use verdicts stay unknown, with internal retention and unknown sharing. Underlying
input rights and publication/software grants remain separate. See

Modifications: the ChEMBL activity and molecule fixtures keep only the fields the clients
request and drop the `molfile` block; the UniChem fixtures keep the compound's InChIKey,
UCI and source list. The RCSB entries hold the fields the structure query requests, including per-instance
ligand neighbours. The rest are verbatim responses, re-serialised as indented, key-sorted
JSON.

## ChEMBL share-alike

ChEMBL is the only source here with a share-alike clause. What it means in practice:

- The ChEMBL fixtures, including the trimmed copies, are redistributed **under CC BY-SA
  3.0**, with the attribution above. They are not relicensed as MIT.
- Sabueso's code is an independent work that reads these files. It is not an adaptation of
  ChEMBL data, so it stays MIT. The repository is a collection of separately licensed
  works, which CC BY-SA 3.0 allows.
- Anything that *is* an adaptation of ChEMBL data, such as a derived dataset built from
  these records, would have to be shared under CC BY-SA 3.0.
- Isolated factual values quoted in tests and reports (an IC50, a ChEMBL id, a compound
  name) are used to document measured behaviour.

This is a good-faith reading, not legal advice. Before a release that redistributes
larger ChEMBL extracts, or a dataset derived from them, confirm the scope with ChEMBL's
current licence statement.

## Adding a fixture

Add a row above with the source, its version or release, the retrieval date and the
licence. If the source is not already listed, check its licence and attribution first,
and record any restriction in `devguide/LICENSING_AND_COMPLIANCE.md`. Keep fixtures
trimmed to what the tests need.

## APPRIS native human gene exporter (development recovery)

`appris/annotations__ENSG00000111669.json` is the unchanged public default JSON
response from `https://apprisws.bioinfo.cnio.es/rest/exporter/id/homo_sapiens/ENSG00000111669?format=json`,
received on 2026-10-06 (exact original retrieval timestamp unrecorded): 252247 bytes,
SHA-256 `e9b7a1f300e76ac359bfc845af03b28f043c9c5b6db14b41a670dd6794de5a95`.
It contains 1010 native occurrences, 60 principal-isoform rows and 21 distinct
transcript references, including repeated/conflicting declarations. Native
genomic coordinates, source labels and note/score/flag strings are unmodified;
assembly/dataset/record/sequence revisions are not stated by these rows.
APPRIS's [official statement](https://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es/partials/license.html)
declares CC BY-NC-SA 4.0: credit APPRIS, link the licence, indicate adaptations,
retain noncommercial use and share-alike obligations. Linked method inputs and
publications retain independent terms; none are fetched with this fixture.

## SIGNOR native causal tables (development recovery)

The three `signor/relations__*.tsv` files are unchanged public responses requested
on 2026-10-06. The original exact retrieval timestamps were not recorded. Native
responses have no header and use the documented 28-field order plus an empty
trailing field. P60174 has three rows; its first native interaction is retained,
including regulator SRC, target TPI1 and the original publication/causal context.
P31749 with requested organism 9606 has 456 rows and native taxonomy literals
9606, 10090, 10116, 9534, -1 and blank; none are reassigned to the requested organism.
P31749 with requested organism 10090 returns exactly `No result found.` (16 bytes),
a source query declaration, not gene or biological absence and not HTTP failure.
Scores, residue/sequence strings, DIRECT flags, sentences and modification/complex
context remain source-served literals. Unknown scientific revisions stay explicit.

[SIGNOR's official documentation](https://signor.uniroma2.it/documentation/), read
2026-10-06, declares CC BY 4.0. Credit SIGNOR and contributing curators, link the
licence and indicate adaptations. Linked publications/input resources retain
independent rights and are not acquired with these responses. The curation manual
and SIGNOR 3.0 score documentation describe their own historical method scope;
neither establishes the current export's score model/version or sequence revision.

## HPA native single-gene summary (development recovery)

The public TPI1 response is retained unchanged from
`https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111669.json`. This documented route supplies
only a subset of search data. Its RNA/protein categorical summaries do not supply
isoform-resolved assays or establish a measured protein identity. The reader keeps
all native quantitative/context fields; categorical mapping does not project
nTPM, nCPM, pTPM, intensity, concentration, scores or prognostic values.

Credit Human Protein Atlas, the specific gene/data URL and appropriate primary
publications; tissue context includes Uhlen et al. (2015),
doi:10.1126/science.1260419. HPA states CC BY 4.0 for copyrightable database parts
and requires respect for third-party input rights. No images, source code or
publication excerpts are included. The original exact retrieval time and native
dataset/gene/sequence revisions remain unknown.

## ClinGen native gene-disease validity export (development recovery)

The public `https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-validity/download` CSV is
retained unchanged, including its native six-row preamble/header/separators and
all 3702 curations. `FILE CREATED: 2026-10-06` is a source file label, not an
observed retrieval time or scientific dataset/sequence revision. Classifications,
mode of inheritance, SOP, expert panel, report namespace and date remain native.
Legacy CGGCIEX report dates may omit timezone; UTC is not filled in.

ClinGen's curated content is dedicated under CC0 1.0. Credit ClinGen, source access
date when actually known and the original panels as requested. The report pointers
are not acquired; publications and external input resources retain separate rights.
No clinical recommendation, strongest classification, protein/isoform or variant
interpretation is inferred. An unlisted gene is distinct from a listed No Known
Disease Relationship declaration and an unavailable/failed response.

## HPO native gene-phenotype release (local unreleased qualification)

`hpo/v2026-09-01/genes_to_phenotype.txt` is the complete unchanged public
[HPO release asset](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/releases/download/v2026-09-01/genes_to_phenotype.txt),
read 2026-10-07 via the download linked by the official JAX website. It contains
333983 six-column rows, 20821704 bytes, SHA-256
`507a17bff9c49e6329fbd88b1f91734fa7e9fdea5c06304044c0892eb6ab248c`.
The first exact acquisition time was not recorded and remains unknown; the dated
release is known from the official redirect, independently of HTTP dates.
No row is rewritten or removed. Credit the Human Phenotype Ontology Consortium
and retain `v2026-09-01`; the supported dataset description is https://hpo.jax.org/.

`hpo/license.component.html` is unchanged public data-licence support from the
[official website source](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/hpo-web/blob/a85f0fa92835a9f6a37881b89b6260ca3b9f4960/src/app/static/resources/license/license.component.html),
read 2026-10-07, 1764 bytes, SHA-256 **cdd288c39f224b07642e59c1b4cd3f81d9f4210cbd4dbf18428dd2749be6c8cd**. The old website route
returns 404; this source is a data statement, not the web software licence.
The HPO Consortium requires acknowledgment/citation, version/date for public
files and unchanged content/logical relationships, and requests website credit/logo.
OMIM/Orphanet and other inputs remain separately scoped. A native disease namespace
is not per-occurrence contributor/publication attribution. These original files
remain local unreleased qualification artifacts; no public derivative collection
or blanket redistribution/commercial-use grant is claimed. Source terms retain
`HPO-CONSORTIUM` with unknown automated-use/sharing and internal retention.

## 3did domain-motif native export (local unreleased qualification)

`3did/3did_dmi_flat.gz` is the complete unchanged public native gzip linked from
[3did's download page](https://3did.irbbarcelona.org/download.php), read 2026-10-07
from https://3did.irbbarcelona.org/download/current/3did_dmi_flat.gz after its
public download access recovered. Original gzip: 149724 bytes, SHA-256
`ef3d339e7643efb3ae2ed1857ecbbc3c350d3cf08ff9ef79daea4c667907bdfb`.
Decoded native text: 826632 bytes, SHA-256
`85fd69fb419b994eb4c506c466e469a22af3bc16af7b042da64f2c58637c93aa`.
All 1657 pairs and 17478 structural occurrences remain unchanged. The first
probe's exact acquisition time is unknown; native scientific/PDB/Pfam/sequence
revisions are unstated, and pattern dates/current-route labels do not replace them.

Credit 3did and the Structural Bioinformatics and Network Biology Group at IRB
Barcelona; retain native Pfam/PLoS_CB_2010 labels and exact structural-instance
support. The provider's public download/about statements do not specify a separate
export-data grant. Terms remain NOT-STATED, with software/publication and input
rights separate. This original factual gzip remains local unreleased qualification
material; no public fixture or derivative-collection distribution grant is claimed.
No coordinates, source publications, DDI contacts or HMM profile data are included.
## PDBTM native XML (local unreleased qualification)

`pdbtm/1c3w.xml` is the complete unchanged public native response from
https://pdbtm.unitmp.org/api/v1/entry/1c3w.xml, first probed 2026-10-06 and
independently matched 2026-10-07. It is **6866 bytes**, SHA-256
`37ae24e30f12457eb91fb9198c5a7a6643e46e33efa0c039048784ff5b7ac55e`, with its
original ISO-8859-1 declaration and entire COPYRIGHT statement retained. Exact
first retrieval time is unrecorded; fixtures keep `retrieved_at=None`. A live
development receipt records 2026-10-07T20:09:18+00:00 separately from this fixture.
All three chain occurrences and 45 region declarations are preserved, together
with history, raw scores, biological/membrane matrices and original sequence text.

The embedded statement identifies PDBTM/Institute of Enzymology, Budapest and
conditions nonprofit-institution use on unchanged content and retained copyright;
use by and for commercial entities requires an agreement. `PDBTM-CONDITIONAL`
records this conditional statement with unknown automated use/sharing and internal
retention. This original remains local unreleased qualification, not a publicly
redistributable fixture or MIT-licensed data. Public derivative collections,
commercial use and input-resource rights require separate qualification. Each
mapped occurrence carries the entire unchanged XML/copyright; XML character
decoding does not rewrite the file. Matrices/raw scores remain uninterpreted, with
units/axes unqualified; no coordinates, transform execution or canonical mapping.

## ProBiS native reference-chain catalog (local unreleased qualification)

`probis/nrpdb-2015-07-31.txt` is the entire unchanged public artifact linked from
[ProBiS-Database](http://probis.cmm.ki.si/?what=database), received from
[the native catalog URL](http://probis.cmm.ki.si/download/nrpdb-2015-07-31.txt)
on 2026-10-07. Its **1003440 bytes**, **42270 headerless five-column rows** have
SHA-256 `2a4f3dd8f3f186f482541c51f177899cbf3c174cc21838dd6a9b185646c12c0a`.
The first probe's exact time is unrecorded; fixture time stays `None`. Independently
matched live receipt: **2026-10-07T20:36:55+00:00**. The dated filename is an
artifact label, not a qualified dataset/PDB/sequence revision.

All padding, gaps, repeated chains and unknown column meanings remain unchanged.
Three `5a2q.h` and five `2ww9.L` occurrences are preserved; `1ytb.A` listing does
not repair a documented `1ytb.B` alignment example. No separate data grant is
qualified (NOT-STATED); software/article licences and input rights remain separate.
This original factual artifact is local unreleased qualification, with automated
sharing unknown; no public fixture or derivative-collection grant is claimed.

## Interactome3D native protein metadata (local unreleased qualification)

`interactome3d/human__2024_12__representative__proteins.dat` is the entire unchanged
public artifact linked from the provider's [archived directory](https://interactome3d.irbbarcelona.org/downloadset.php?path=representative&queryid=human&release=2024_12).
[Native file](https://interactome3d.irbbarcelona.org/data/previous_releases/2024_12/human/representative/proteins.dat)
received 2026-10-07: **1618274 bytes**, **18000** fourteen-column rows, SHA-256
`bb1671bedacab71e528a18c1d7f662046fe61d299b70da791f1b61325098d83d`.
First probe exact time is unrecorded; fixture `retrieved_at=None`. Independent live
match: **2026-10-07T20:51:35+00:00**. The selected archive label is separate from
unstated native export/PDB/sequence revisions.

The unchanged table retains 10636 Structure and 7364 Model occurrences, including
251 whitespace-chain rows and multiple representative structures/models per accession.
Native [help](https://interactome3d.irbbarcelona.org/help.php) qualifies identity/
coverage as percentages; scores and endpoints remain distinct. The provider/about
page does not qualify a separate data grant (NOT-STATED). Attribution retains
Interactome3D/IRB Barcelona, artifact scope, original row/hash; software/articles
and input rights are separate. This original factual artifact stays local unreleased,
with automated sharing unknown; no public fixture/derivative redistribution grant.

## Pharos target metadata (2026-10-07, local unreleased qualification)

`pharos/target__P60174.json`, `pharos/target__P31749.json` and
`pharos/target__P00000.json`
are unchanged public responses from the provider-documented
https://pharos-api.ncats.io/graphql endpoint. Query: `SabuesoTarget($accession:
String!) { target(q: {uniprot: $accession}) { name sym uniprot tdl fam } }`.
They preserve native five-field targets and explicit null respectively; no search
or aggregate source is acquired. Provider/NIH IDG attribution and contributing
source rights remain separate. A separate data grant is NOT-STATED; article/code
licences are not assigned to outputs. Keep original factual fixtures local and
unreleased pending applicable sharing qualification.

## DepMap 24Q4 public release (2026-10-07)

`depmap/24Q4__Model.csv`, `depmap/24Q4__README.txt` and
`depmap/24Q4__figshare_27993248__v1.json` are unchanged public provider artifacts.

## BRENDA EC-class descriptions (2026-10-07)

The public prototype linked by [BRENDA](https://brenda-enzymes.org/download.php)
uses [the DSMZ endpoint](https://sparql.dsmz.de/brenda) and its D3O schema.
These three original JSON responses select `ec label name description` for
one exact EC URI, with independent OPTIONAL systematic-name and description
bindings, without LIMIT or OFFSET. Queries and RDF terms are reproduced by
`sabueso.mappings.brenda.response_query`; this is descriptive class context,
not kinetic measurements or a protein assignment. EC 5.3.1.1 has a native empty
description; 2.7.1.1 has a nonempty description; 7.99.99.99999 has zero solutions.
The no-match probe is not an assigned biological class or an absence assertion.

Original SHA-256 hashes respectively:

## FDA OOPD detailed pages (2026-10-08 UTC, 2026-10-07 local)

Original public [page 476815](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/detailedIndex.cfm?cfgridkey=476815)
and [page 106597](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/detailedIndex.cfm?cfgridkey=106597)
are preserved without edits, including original CRLF and nested HTML tables:

  `6bbe6fe07e08d5361d16d0eff3ce03f3f0895308cdf263fe1b6539e4fd645b65`.
  An HTTP-200 form returned instead of requested data must fail reader qualification.

Native acquisitions occurred at 05:25:35 UTC for the detailed pages and 05:23:39 UTC
for the form. Scientific dataset/record revisions are unstated. Native procedural
dates, N/A, blank exclusivity fields, repeated product-name strings and sponsor
address qualifiers remain original. The page locator is not a stable designation,
product or protein identifier and is not echoed by the HTML.

The explicitly linked [FDA website policy](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/about-website/website-policies)
states public-domain reuse unless otherwise noted; independent contributing-source
and other rights remain separate. Credit to U.S. Food and Drug Administration /
Office of Orphan Products Development is requested. Retain the source URL and
acquisition date. This is not an openFDA CC0 grant or current clinical advice.

## TTD target listing (2026-10-07, local unreleased qualification)

The [official download component](https://ttd.idrblab.cn/full-data-download)
explicitly links the original public
[`P2-01-TTD_uniprot_all.txt`](https://ttd.idrblab.cn/files/download/P2-01-TTD_uniprot_all.txt).
The full unchanged file is 525950 bytes, SHA-256
`74b2dbb4c03e14b01d02b54bdce45507da0da1e457859e1669cdf76b39feb22e`.
Its native header states version 10.1.01 (2024.01.10); 4298 target blocks have
TARGETID/UNIPROID/TARGNAME/TARGTYPE fields, including 613 NOUNIPROTAC values.
UNIPROID is not uniformly an accession; native entry names, inconsistencies and
placeholders are not repaired. Native TARGTYPE is source context, not a derived
clinical or druggability finding. The source footer reserves rights and no
separate data grant is qualified. NOT-STATED keeps automated use/sharing unknown;
original factual qualification stays local unreleased. Article/software rights
are not assigned to this export. Credit TTD, IDRB/Zhejiang University and
BIDD/National University of Singapore, retaining the full native header and URL.

## iPTMnet native report pages (2026-10-07)

Original public [P60174](https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/entry/P60174/)
and provider-linked sample [Q15796](https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/entry/Q15796/)

P60174 has 72 rows (62/7/3 by group); Q15796 has 60 (42/15/3), including an
unplaced modification and native score0. Rows retain source aggregate support;
no canonical placement, independent enzyme/source/PMID pairing or curated/
inferred classification is reconstructed. Dataset and sequence revisions stay
unknown. Other report sections are raw received support, not separately mapped.
