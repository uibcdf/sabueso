# About

Sabueso is an integration, normalization, and traceability library for
biomolecular and chemical data. It is designed for molecular design pipelines
where users need reproducible Cards and Decks built from heterogeneous sources.

## Mission

Convert fragmented source records into structured molecular intelligence with
explicit evidence and deterministic field-level selection.

## Vision

Provide a stable data layer for MolSysSuite so researchers and tools can share
cards, compare results, and automate decisions with transparent provenance.

Sabueso is intended to be:

- Accessible to everyone.
- Free for users to use and modify.
- Flexible.
- Powerful.
- Easy to use.
- Fast.

## Scope

Current focus:

- Proteins and protein-related structural/functional annotations.
- Small molecules from major public sources.
- Card/Deck persistence in JSON/JSONL/SQLite.
- Offline and online testing strategy.

Planned evolution:

- Stronger `ops` layer semantics.
- Expanded canonical mappings and coverage.
- Deeper developer and API documentation.

## Project Status

Sabueso is in active development. Core building blocks are already available,
but some modules are intentionally minimal placeholders while interfaces are
stabilized.

For implementation status and roadmap decisions, see the developer guide in
`devguide/` in the repository.
