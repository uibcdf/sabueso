# Clinical layer

A molecule card can hold what its sources state about the molecule's clinical use: the
indications ChEMBL records, with their maximum phase, and the registered trials those
indications cite.

```{note}
The clinical layer is on main, not yet in a release.
```

```python
import sabueso

card, _ = sabueso.resolve("chembl:CHEMBL110", trials={})  # benznidazole
view = card.clinical()
view["max_phase"]  # 4.0, ChEMBL's maximum phase for the molecule
for indication in view["indications"]:
    print(indication["disease"], indication["disease_term"], indication["max_phase"])
for trial in view["trials"][:3]:
    print(trial["trial"], trial["status"], trial.get("phases"), trial["cited_for"])
```

## Options

- `indications=True` adds ChEMBL's drug indications of the molecule's ChEMBL records.
- `trials={}`, or `trials={"limit": 50}`, also adds the ClinicalTrials.gov studies those
  indications cite, by NCT id. It implies `indications`. The default limit is 100, and
  a cut is reported with a warning.

## What it holds

- **Indications** (`investigated_for`):
  - the disease term as ChEMBL states it (EFO, MONDO, DOID…) and its MeSH heading;
  - the maximum phase for that indication. Phase 4 is approval, as ChEMBL states it;
    phases 1 to 3 are investigational;
  - the references ChEMBL cites: ClinicalTrials.gov, ATC, FDA, EMA, DailyMed.

  Two terms that share a MeSH heading stay two rows. Benznidazole has two for Chagas
  disease, `efo:EFO:0008559` and `mondo:MONDO:0001444`, because ChEMBL states both.
- **Trials** (`tested_in`): what ClinicalTrials.gov states about each trial:
  - status, phases, study type and enrolment;
  - dates, conditions and lead sponsor;
  - the interventions, as written.

  `cited_for` names the indications that cite the trial. A cited id that
  ClinicalTrials.gov does not hold is kept, with `registry: not_found`.
- **Not fetched.** `not_fetched` lists cited trials the card did not fetch, because
  trials were not requested or were past the limit.

## Why trials come only through ChEMBL

A trial names its interventions as text: a drug name, a brand name, a code. Matching
that text to a molecule would join identities by name, which Sabueso never does. So
Sabueso asks only for the trials ChEMBL cites for the molecule's indications. The link's
basis is ChEMBL's statement, recorded on every trial (`basis:
chembl_drug_indication`).

DrugBank's clinical content is not used: its licence (CC BY-NC 4.0) does not allow
redistribution across MOLI.
