# Sabueso — Use Cases (Agreed Scenarios)

These scenarios reflect concrete user needs discussed during design.

## 1) Protein interactions, ligands, pathways
Given a protein:
- retrieve interacting proteins
- retrieve known ligands and inhibitors (when applicable)
- retrieve pathway involvement

## 2) Clinical usage of ligands
Given candidate ligands:
- identify which have reported clinical use
- surface clinical data from DrugBank datasets

## 3) TopoMT integration
- map catalytic residues and inhibitory mutations to structural features
- provide positional features for cavity analysis

## 4) PharmacophoreMT screening
- screen a molecule library using a Deck of ligands

## 5) Commercial availability of peptides
- list peptide availability and vendors

## 6) Tissue‑specific isoforms
- report isoforms and tissue‑specific expression

## 7) Visualization (MolSysViewer)
- visualize secondary structure, protein‑protein interfaces, known mutations

## 8) Clinical trials for ligands
- report whether a ligand has clinical trials

## 9) Disease associations
- find diseases associated with a protein
- list possible targets for a disease
