# Sabueso — Licensing and Compliance

## External Data Sources
Some sources have license or access restrictions. These must be respected in:
- caching strategy
- redistribution of data
- packaging and distribution

## Known Sensitive Sources
- **DrugBank**: data downloads are license‑controlled. Clinical datasets may be restricted.
- **eMolecules**: data downloads may require license agreements.
- **ChemSpider**: API access requires a key and has usage conditions.

## Compliance Principles
- Do not redistribute restricted datasets without permission.
- Store only what is required for reproducibility when licenses allow.
- Ensure any caching respects source terms.
