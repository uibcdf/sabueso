# Sabueso — Future Expansions

## LLM Assistance
Potential LLM‑assisted features:
- consensus selection (augment rules)
- summarization of card sections
- disambiguation of ambiguous inputs

Open decision:
- Use **MolSys‑AI** as the LLM backend or embed a **Sabueso‑specific LLM**.
- If LLM outputs are used, they must be stored as explicit evidence objects with source attribution.

## Ecosystem Integration
Deeper integration with MolSysSuite tools:
- TopoMT: map positional features to cavity and surface analyses.
- PharmacophoreMT: use decks of ligands for screening workflows.
- MolSysMT: use Card/Deck metadata to annotate simulation systems.

## Additional Sources
Potential future data sources beyond the initial set:
- additional PPI databases
- disease/phenotype resources
- clinical trial registries
