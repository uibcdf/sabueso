# Sabueso — Next Steps

## Immediate
1) Confirm the final list of canonical field paths.
2) Define a stable field‑path naming convention for rules and evidence objects.
3) Decide how to represent `location` for positional features (range model).

## Short Term
4) Draft database module interfaces (input/output contracts).
5) Implement UniProt database module prototype and evidence extraction.
6) Implement PDB database module prototype and evidence extraction.

## Medium Term
7) Implement aggregator for at least ProteinCard.
8) Implement selection rules for a minimal subset of fields.
9) Add caching strategy and local storage format.
