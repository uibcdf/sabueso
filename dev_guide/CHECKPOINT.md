# Sabueso — Checkpoint (Current Repo State)

This file records the current repository baseline so new developers can resume exactly from this state.

## Repository Structure (Created)
- `sabueso/`
  - `core/` (placeholders: `card.py`, `deck.py`, `evidence_store.py`)
  - `resolver/` (placeholder: `base.py`)
  - `tools/db/`, `tools/card/`, `tools/deck/`
  - `ops/` (placeholders: `card_ops.py`, `deck_ops.py`)
  - `mappings/` (README placeholder)
  - `utils/` (internal utilities only; currently empty)
- `docs/`
  - `conf.py` (Sphinx, **pydata_sphinx_theme**)
  - `index.rst` (minimal)
  - `README.md` (placeholder)
- `tests/` (directories created with `.gitkeep`)

## Notes
- `schemas/card_schema.yaml` remains a **conceptual** schema draft.
- The `schemas/` directory is **temporary** until Card/Deck classes are fully defined.
- Phase‑0 focus is on structure, interfaces, and documentation, not implementation.
