"""``sabueso.knowledge_packet``: resolve, compose, pin and store in one call (#71).

The query alone decides what is asked of the sources (``packet_aspects@3``). The
keyword arguments only choose how the sources are reached: a ``resolver`` and the
source clients (``chembl_client=…``), for example fixture clients offline. They never
add or change knowledge options, so the packet's query says everything it holds.
