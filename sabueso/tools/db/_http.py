"""The one way source clients reach the network (#82, #83, #86).

- **A named client.** Some servers refuse Python's default user agent (DISEASES's
  downloads, Reactome's Content Service answer 403). Every request carries Sabueso's
  name and version.
- **Retries for transient failures.** HTTP 429, 502, 503 and 504, and a refused or
  reset connection, are retried up to ``RETRIES`` times, waiting longer each time
  (``Retry-After`` is honoured, up to ``MAX_WAIT`` seconds). Every Sabueso request is a
  read (GraphQL posts too), so a retry changes nothing on the source.
- **What is not retried.** A timeout: the source has already had its time, and asking
  again would multiply it. Any other error reaches the client unchanged, which
  decides whether a source's 404 states absence or is a connector failure.
- **An unreadable answer** (#97). A client that reads JSON asks with
  ``expect_json=True``: a 200 whose body is empty or not JSON is asked again, the same
  number of times, since services sometimes answer a request with a page that is not the
  answer. A second failure reaches the client, which reports it as an error.
  A client may opt into an exactly empty HTTP 200 body when its source documents
  that absence form; other clients keep the default unreadable-body behavior.
- **Retries are recorded** (#97). Inside ``noting_retries()`` (a card's build), each
  retry is noted with its source and reason, and the card lists them
  (``quality.retries``): an answer that needed a retry is never silent.

Clients import ``urlopen`` from here instead of ``urllib.request``.

- **What was downloaded** (#100). While a retrieval archive is recording
  (``tools.db._archive``), every final answer, a 404 included, is kept there, and the
  client receives it as it would have.
- **When an answer was read** (``stamp``, #100). A client opens a stamp when it starts
  asking, and uses ``stamp.value`` as the retrieval time of what it returns: the time
  of its first answer when an archive is active (so that a record and the statements
  taken from it agree, and a replayed answer keeps its original time), else the time
  the client started.
- **Many requests to one service** (``gather``, #98). A source answered one record per
  request (UniChem, one compound at a time) is asked by a few threads at once, never
  faster than the pace the service asks for or Sabueso chooses to keep (``Pace``).
  Results come back in the order asked; a failure of one request is that request's
  answer, never the others'.
