"""Ligand sites of a protein crossed with its annotated sites (uibcdf/sabueso#28).

A ProteinCard can hold independent statements about where things bind:

- the functional sites UniProt annotates (``features_positional.active_site`` and
  ``binding_site``), each with its ECO evidence and, for binding sites, its ligand;
- the sites InterPro member databases place on the sequence from their family models
  (``features_positional.family_site``, e.g. CDD's catalytic triad, substrate binding site
  and dimer interface);
- the residues each ligand contacts in experimental structures, from PDBe-KB
  (``has_ligand_site`` relationships), in UniProt numbering.

``ligand_sites_view`` puts them side by side. Whether a ligand site overlaps an annotated
site is derived knowledge, computed here with rule ``annotated_site_overlap@2``: an exact
match of residue positions in UniProt numbering, against every annotated site. It is
never stored. Each overlap names the annotation and its source, because overlapping a
catalytic triad and overlapping a dimer interface mean different things.

Absence states stay distinct. "No annotated overlap" is not "binds elsewhere": UniProt
annotations are sparse (four residues for TIM), and a ligand can bind next to an annotated
residue without contacting it. When the card has no annotated site at all, the class says
so instead. Proximity over coordinates is not computed here; see uibcdf/sabueso#30.

Whether one ligand contacts more than one chain can only be read from **instance-level**
contacts. PDBe-KB aggregates all copies of a ligand, and its per-residue chains cannot
tell one ligand touching two chains from two copies in two chains. The card holds
per-instance contacts (from RCSB) only for the structures it has fetched, so
``spans_chains`` is ``None`` when no instance-level data is available, never ``[]``.
